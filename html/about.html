          <div class="about-me">
            <p class="paragraph">I'm a passionate and self-driven full-stack web developer with a strong focus on front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and back-end development with Node.js. My journey into tech began in high school, where I was first introduced to coding, and it was reignited later through the Resilient Coders program. After gaining some initial exposure, I took it upon myself to deepen my knowledge by diving into free, self-paced courses on FreeCodeCamp. This allowed me to build a solid foundation in CSS, JavaScript, and full-stack development, and has fueled my ongoing love for learning and creating software.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              As a developer, I thrive on solving problems and building intuitive, user-friendly applications. Whether it's styling with CSS, optimizing a backend with Node.js, or building a responsive web interface, I love the process of making things work smoothly. Software development is more than just a career for me—it's a hobby and one of my favorite ways to spend my spare time. I'm always excited to explore new technologies and approaches to improve my craft.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              I'm particularly interested in remote work opportunities, as I value the flexibility it offers and thrive in an environment where I can focus on delivering quality work while continuously learning. I’m looking for opportunities where I can grow alongside a team, contribute to meaningful projects, and make a real impact through my code.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
