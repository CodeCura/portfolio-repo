        <p class="paragraph-header">My <span id="unique">Story</span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">
I’m someone who thrives in discomfort because that’s where the magic happens. From a young age, I actively sought out challenges that would force me to grow — from tackling social anxiety to working my first job at 16 as a commissioned sales rep. What I learned in those early days shaped me: structured conversations, adaptability, and understanding how to turn rejection into fuel for progress.
        </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
In my journey, I’ve seen firsthand how resilience and adaptability aren’t just “soft skills” — they’re essential for success in both business and life. Working in service industries, like bars and cafes, taught me that behind every customer interaction is an opportunity for growth, and even in volatile environments, you can find ways to thrive. It’s not just about providing a product — it’s about creating an experience that connects with people. That’s what inspired my shift to tech. I started learning web development to scale what I already loved — solving problems and improving systems.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
Fast forward, and I began working with small businesses, helping them optimize operations, increase efficiency, and leverage data to make informed decisions. I’m passionate about using Lean Six Sigma principles and modern technology to streamline processes, whether it's through the implementation of new point-of-sale systems, refining inventory management, or gathering competitive data. Every time I saw inefficiencies, I thought, “This could be better.” That’s the mindset I bring to the table: identifying opportunities to innovate and create solutions that move businesses forward.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
What excites me about opportunities in tech is the chance to bring together my non-traditional, hands-on experience with my love for tech, data, and e-commerce. I understand that in today’s fast-paced world, being in touch with the customer, their needs, and how they interact with a product is crucial — and that’s where I shine. Whether it’s building processes from the ground up or refining existing systems, I’m always looking for ways to make things better, faster, and more impactful.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
I want to inspire your team with my ability to think critically and empathetically, while still delivering results. To me, it’s about combining the best of both worlds: using intuition gained from real-world experience, and leveraging data-driven insights to propel businesses forward. My work isn’t about just getting the job done — it’s about making every move count, because every decision, every function, and every line of code, matters.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
With my diverse background and growth mindset, I’m ready to help teams scale, innovate, and redefine what’s possible in e-commerce and technology. Let’s take this journey together.
